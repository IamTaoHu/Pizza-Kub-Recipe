            <h1>Pizza Dip</h1>

                    <p> ㅤㅤㅤ Pizza is one of my all-time favorite foods. And when I’m hosting a party, there’s always going to be plenty of dips. So of course I made an epic pizza dip recipe!
                        This pizza dip is sure to make an appearance at my annual Super Bowl party, holiday party, and pretty much every other party I throw! This dip is truly delicious
                        and it’s easy to make ahead of time, so I can pop it in the oven right before party time</p>
                    <p>ㅤ</p>
                    <p>The best part is, the buttery bread used to dip up the hot pizza dip is baked right in the skillet with the dip, so it’s a one-pot appetizer. And less dishes is always a win in my book!</p>

                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Refrigerated canned biscuits</strong>&nbsp;– any 16 ounce can of unflavored biscuits will work for this recipe.</li>
                        <li><strong>Butter</strong> </li> 
                        <li><strong>Parmesan cheese</strong> – just like your favorite pizza, the pull apart bread surrounding the dip is topped with grated parmesan cheese.</li>
                        <li><strong>Italian seasoning</a></strong>– I highly recommend my homemade seasoning, linked here. It’s so flavorful and easy to mix up in less than 5 minutes, with herbs like basil, thyme and oregano. You can also purchase pre-made Italian seasoning on the spice aisle at the grocery store.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cream cheese</strong> – combine with ricotta cheese to make a creamy, cheesy base for the dip. Always make sure to leave the cream cheese out on the counter for at least 30 minutes before making the dip to soften it up. This way, it will easily mix in with the ricotta cheese.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ricotta cheese</strong> – whole milk ricotta is my preference for it’s rich flavor and creamy texture.</li>
                        <li><strong>Marinara sauce</strong> – I recommend using either homemade marinara sauce or Rao’s marinara sauce (my favorite store brand sauce in a jar). You can also use a jar of pizza sauce.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mozzarella cheese</strong> – I always recommend grating the cheese at home yourself. The bags of pre-shredded cheese at the grocery store contain anti-caking additives that prevent them from melting as well.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pepperoni </strong>(optional topping) – you can also make the dip vegetarian by topping it with sliced mushrooms, diced bell peppers, sliced black olives, or your favorite veggie pizza topping.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Prepare the pizza dip.</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use a large bowl and an electric hand mixer</a>, or stand mixer</a>, to combine softened cream cheese with ricotta cheese and Italian seasoning. Spread the cream cheese mixture in the middle of the seasoned balls of dough in the skillet.</li>      
                        <li>Top the cheesy mixture with marinara sauce.</li>   
                        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese and Italian seasoning on top of the marinara sauce.</li>
                        <li>Slice each of the pepperonis into 4 pieces and sprinkle them on top of the mozzarella cheese. This is an optional topping, and you’re welcome to use another pizza topping of your choice.</li>
                        <li>Bake the pizza dip in the oven at 350°F for 25-30 minutes.</li>
